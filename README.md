Building Geoprocessing Tools with Python: Beyond the Basics

This session will focus on creating polished, well-designed and useful geoprocessing tools with Python. We’ll discuss validation in more depth, and cover debugging script tools. We’ll also focus on strategies for organizing and distributing your toolbox code, and creating tools that behave well as geoprocessing services.
